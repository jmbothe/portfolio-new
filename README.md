## Description

This is the first non-tutorial-based site I've built with React.js. It's super simple and showcases the core of React's architectural patterns. After writing a lot fo vanilla JS and jQuesry, using React was a breath of fresh air. Even while using the MVC patter, I always felt like my code was spaghetti. Using React was very intuitive for me, and by comparison I felt like I was making ravioli for the first time.
